Java Callgraph
Technologies: Java, JaCoCo

• Developed a static call graph generator for Java projects using Java and various libraries including JGraphT, BCEL, and Reflections

• Implemented graph algorithms to analyze and optimize call graphs, including reachability analysis, pruning, and ancestry computation

• Created functionality to parse JAR files, extract method calls, and construct directed graphs representing software architecture

• Integrated code coverage data from JaCoCo to enhance call graph with runtime execution information
